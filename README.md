💳 Credit Score Classification using Machine Learning
📖 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning–based system to classify customer credit scores into three categories:

0 → Poor

1 → Standard

2 → Good

The objective is to automate creditworthiness assessment and reduce financial risk for lending institutions.

🎯 Business Problem

Manual and rule-based credit evaluation is:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Inconsistent

Financial institutions require an automated, data-driven system to classify credit risk accurately and reduce default probability.
